[0.1.3-0] Conflicting/alternative dependencies:
    Conflicting and alternative dependencies are currently not handled.

[0.1.3.1-0] Spurious builds when using update (-u):
    When multiple ports are specified for update (non-recursive) it could cause
    extra ports to be installed.  This may happen if a dependency is installed
    but it has an uninstalled dependency (e.g. options changed).  That
    uninstalled dependency will be installed, but is not required to be.
