[0.1.3-0] Conflicting/alternative dependencies:
    Conflicting and alternative dependencies are currently not handled.

[0.1.3.1-0] Spurious builds when using update (-u):
    When multiple ports are specified for update (non-recursive) it could cause
    extra ports to be installed.  This may happen if a dependency is installed
    but it has an uninstalled dependency (e.g. options changed).  That
    uninstalled dependency will be installed, but is not required to be.

[0.1.4-0] Corrupted output when using command display (-n)
    When a port tries to configure it will corrupt the output as the commands
    are still printed.  To avoid this use '-nc none' instead to prevent a port
    from configuring.  To pre-configure the ports use '-N' instead of '-n'.
