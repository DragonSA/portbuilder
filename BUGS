[0.1.3-0] Conflicting/alternative dependencies:
    Conflicting and alternative dependencies are currently not handled.

[0.1.4-0] Corrupted output when using command display (-n):
    When a port tries to configure it will corrupt the output as the commands
    are still printed.  To avoid this use '-nc none' instead to prevent a port
    from configuring.  To pre-configure the ports use '-N' instead of '-n'.

[0.1.4-1] Port's with non-default targets:
    Dependencies with non-default target (such as extra or build) are not
    currently handled.

[0.1.5-0] Spurious builds when using update (-u):
    When multiple ports are specified for update (non-recursive) it could cause
    extra ports to be installed.  This will happen if a port's run or library
    dependencies have changed (preciously, added).
